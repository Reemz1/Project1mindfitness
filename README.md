# Mindfitness #

Mindfitness is a website that documents workouts that can be performed both in the gym and in the home, with easy to follow steps and images. There is also information about the specific muscles that are targeted with each workout. 

The intention behind this website is to make working out easy to understand and access for all people, as working out increases a person's motivation, helps improve their mood, and makes them more aware and in tune with themselves, hence the name. 

This website targets those who may be new to working out and need ideas, or those who are looking for ways to be more mindful.

At the moment there are three workouts documented on each page, however there are plans to increase the amount of workouts and range of workouts documented.
